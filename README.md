### Description

V1.1 Now! i have fixed Auto ScreenMode Selection.

My V1.0 DX8 Class Module is now finished :) !

Here is a nice (i think) example, what u can do with it.

There not really all functions i could implement,

but with this Version u can start play around with DX8 and my Class :).

Modify it as u like - it contains : Auto Screen Mode Detect, Light, Texture, Custom Meshes, Transforms, Background, MousePointer ...

Sorry for the less Comments in Code, but havent got much time to write a nice Doc.

have fun ...

PS: if u Vote for me, the functions will be more in next Version (and a Doc maybe) :P

(if something not working, plz leave a message)
